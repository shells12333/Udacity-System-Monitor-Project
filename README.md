# CppND-System-Monitor

System Monitor Project from Udacity. Starter code was provided as template. All exercises/implementations by the student (me) were wherever there is a TODO listed. All TODOs were left to highlight where exactly I was to develop a solution. There are a few display issues, which I am unsure how to fix, as this project was my first and was meant to maintain a grasp of C++, and the ncurses library used was not taught nor the objective of development within this project. 


The project consists of simple ways to read and display information about a given Linux system. This information underlines the general CPU usage, uptime, and utilization of different processes. The software's theme closely resembles htop, providing a clean interface to show the highlighted parts of a computer. Importantly, this project was my first, so the code is not as robust or professional as a novice program would appear.
